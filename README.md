# Laravel-CMS

##Introduction
This was built for my final PHP project last year. We were asked to build our own CMS using Laravel. 

##Options
This CMS allows you to easily add content to your website from an administrative back end in a similar fashion to WordPress. 

####Content
The backend provides functionality to add several different forms of content to your page.

These include:
+ New Users
+ Pages
+ Articles
+ Content Areas
+ Custom CSS

####Users

1. Admin
  * This user has access too all features of the site.

2. Editor
  * This user can make new pages, post new articles, add content areas
  
3. Author
  * This user can post and edit new articles
